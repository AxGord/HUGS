HUGS!

Haxe Unity Glue...Stuff!
-------------------------
This library includes Haxe externs for Unity and .NET frameworks, generated via the cslibgen utility. It also
includes the HUGSWrapper "using" class, which includes various things to work around Haxe/C# translation issues, as
well as make working with Unity easier.


Documentation forthcoming...
